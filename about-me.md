Hi! I was born in Chennai, India and moved to Boston, Massachusetts when I was 6 months old. My family moved around to Illinois and Wisconscin until we settled in Fremont, CA. In 2012, I graduated from Irvington High School. In 2016, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

Outside of research, I love tennis and crew. I played tennis competitively in USTA throughout high school. I was part of CAL Lightweight Crew during undergrad.

Apart from sports, for over 10 years, I trained in ballet at [Mission Dance and Perfoming Arts](http://missiondancefremont.com).

Throughout college, I was a part of [CAL Nerds](http://calnerds.berkeley.edu) and am passionate about mentoring younger students towards access to STEM education. I currently am a volunteer with [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com).

If any of these sound interesting to you, don't hesistate to reach out. I'd love to meet up and grab coffee :)
