Hi! I am a recent graduate from [UC Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu) undergraduate program. Currently, I am a researcher in Professor [Claire Tomlin's](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tomlin/) [Hybrid Systems Lab](http://hybrid.eecs.berkeley.edu). In November, I will be starting as a Software Engineer for Uber's Machine Learning team.

I will be applying to PhD programs this fall. My current research interests are in automation, control theory, power & energy systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles.
