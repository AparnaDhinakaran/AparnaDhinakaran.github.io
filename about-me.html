<p>Hi! I was born in Chennai, India and moved to Boston, Massachusetts when I was 6 months old. My family moved around to Illinois and Wisconscin until we settled in Fremont, CA. In 2012, I graduated from Irvington High School. In 2016, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.</p>
<p>Outside of research, I love tennis and crew. I played tennis competitively in USTA throughout high school. I was part of CAL Lightweight Crew during undergrad.</p>

<p>Apart from sports, for over 10 years, I trained in ballet at <a href="http://missiondancefremont.com">Mission Dance and Perfoming Arts</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout college, I was a part of <a href="http://calnerds.berkeley.edu">CAL Nerds</a> and am passionate about mentoring younger students towards access to STEM education. I currently am a volunteer with <a href="https://girlswhocode.com">Girls Who Code</a>.</p>
