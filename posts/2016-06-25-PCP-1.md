This post is the first in a series that seeks to explain the PCP Theorem in
a manner understandable to undergraduate students.

The Probabilistically Checkable Proof (PCP) Theorem is the culmination of a series of
works that investigated what it means to actually *prove* a statement. The
traditional view of a proof is a string that the verifier goes over with
a fine-toothed comb, looking for flaws in the logic. The verifier's access to
the proof string is bounded only by its (polynomially-bounded) running time, and
the verification algorithm is entirely deterministic.

In the PCP formulation of a proof, however, the verifier can flip coins, but
can query the proof string only a limited number of times. Surprisingly, the
PCP theorem states that everything that can be proved in the traditional model
can be checked in this new formulation.

Formally, the PCP Theorem says that $\NP = \PCP[\log(n), 3]$. This means that a verifier
that flips just $\log(n)$ coins and queries a candidate proof in just $3$ locations
can verify any efficiently-verifiable mathematical statement!
